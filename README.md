# 🐍 Python Project Template

A clean and modern template to kickstart your Python projects with best practices.  
Includes tools like `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `pre-commit`, and `commitizen`.

---

## 📃 .gitignore

`.gitignore` tells Git which files or directories to ignore.  
It's essential to exclude files generated by IDEs, environments, build processes, or files containing sensitive data.

✅ Example:  

pycache/, .env, .DS_Store, .venv/

---

## 📝 .gitmessage

Configure a global commit message template to follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage
```

📌 This helps ensure consistent commit messages across contributors.

---

## 🧹 .pre-commit-config.yaml

Pre-commit runs checks before each commit.

It automates formatting and linting using tools like:

* black 🖤 — Code formatter

* isort 📚 — Import sorter

* flake8 🐛 — Linter (with flake8-bugbear)

* commitizen 🧠 — Enforce commit conventions

```bash
# Install and activate
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

---

## ⚙️ pyproject.toml

A modern, standardized configuration file for Python projects.
Defines metadata, dependencies, and build systems (PEP 518 compliant).

📦 To extract only the actual packages used in your project:

```bash
pipreqs .
```

---

## 📄 README.md

Your project’s front door 🚪
Include clear instructions for:

Installation 🛠️

Usage 🚀

Contribution guidelines 🤝

License 📜

This file is the first thing others will see, so keep it clean and helpful!

---

## 🧠 src/ Directory

Stores your main source code.

Following the src/ layout helps separate logic from configs, docs, and tests — enhancing maintainability.

🧩 Good structure = easier collaboration.

---

## ✅ tests/ Directory

Contains all your unit and integration tests.

Keeping tests isolated from your core logic allows for cleaner CI/CD and better organization.

Run tests using:
```bash
pytest
```

---

## 🔍 .flake8

Flake8 config for consistent linting across your codebase.

```ini
[flake8]
max-line-length = 100
extend-ignore = B008,B009
```

📌 `flake8` doesn't support `pyproject.toml`, so a separate file is required.
Use this to define rules, file exclusions, and plugin settings.

---

## 🧪 How to Get Started

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
pip install .[dev]

# Run formatters & linters
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run tests
pytest
```

---

## 🧠 Tips
* ✅ Use cz commit for structured commit messages.
* ✅ Tag releases with cz bump.
* ✅ Stay consistent by running pre-commit on CI as well.
